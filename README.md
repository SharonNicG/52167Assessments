## Introduction
Welcome to the thrilling world of post-lecture exercises!

Watch as I stumble through scripts that I will, hopefully, someday look back upon with the derision a 2-year-old shows any toy they have played with for more than a few minutes.

If you’re anything like me you’ll get to the end wanting to fix, tinker and occasionally take everything apart and start again but also with your curiosity piqued and a desire to learn more.

Enjoy!

### Overview of Exercises
Each task was completed in the order assigned and later uploaded to GitHub.

Exercise|File|Description
-------------|----|------------------
**1 & 2**|[fibonacci.py](https://github.com/SharonNicG/52167Assessments/blob/master/fibonacci.py)|Single file entry containing a script for exercises 1 & 2 using a modified script to calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of my first name as numbers, including ord() function and explanation of same.
**3**|[collatz.py](https://github.com/SharonNicG/52167Assessments/blob/master/collatz.py)|A single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. Each iteration prints, the current value of the integer to the screen.
**4**|[euler_5.py](https://github.com/SharonNicG/52167Assessments/blob/master/euler_5.py)|A Python program using for and range to solve 'Project Euler Problem 5: Smallest multiple' "2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?"
**5**|[irisdataset.py](https://github.com/SharonNicG/52167Assessments/blob/master/irisdataset.py)|A Python script that reads the Iris dataset in and prints the four numerical values (associated with petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width) on each row with the decimal places aligned and a space between the columns.
**6**|[factorial.py](https://github.com/SharonNicG/52167Assessments/blob/master/factorial.py)|A Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial and tests the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
